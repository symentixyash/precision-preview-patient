            <div style="height:27px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p><strong>Why is early detection of lung cancer important?<a id="top" class="anchor"
                        name="q1"></a></strong><br>Detection of cancer at its earlier stages is key to reducing cancer
                mortality. At an early stage, cancer is more likely to still be localized, not spread to other parts of
                the
                body, which makes treatment less caustic and more successful. People at high risk for lung cancer are
                recommended for annual screening with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) to find cancer at earlier
                stages
                when it can be successfully treated. The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial1 (NLCST) of more than
                53,000
                patients showed LDCT screening could lower mortality rates by 20% as compared to screening with
                traditional
                X-ray.&nbsp; It is very important for people at high risk for lung cancer to be screened annually for
                the
                disease. Early detection of lung cancer is key to increasing the survival rate of patients.</p>



            <div style="height:47px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p><strong>Why is CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung important for early detection of lung cancer?<a id="top"
                        class="anchor" name="q2"></a><br></strong>While widespread use of LDCT will help lower the death
                rate from lung cancer, the NLCST found that LDCT screening has a low positive predictive value of 3.8%.
                That
                means that for every 100 people who were diagnosed by LDCT as positive for lung cancer, less than four
                of
                them actually had the disease. The low positive predictive value can lead to more expensive and riskier
                procedures to diagnose lung cancer. People at high risk may decide not to be screened because of the
                anxiety, cost and risk of a positive LDCT result that turns out to be incorrect. That is a
                mistake.&nbsp;
                Screening for lung cancer is essential if we want to diagnose early-stage cancer and save lives.</p>



            <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>A patient-friendly, accurate and cost effective test like CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung offers significant
                benefits. The use of CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung after a positive LDCT scan can increase the positive
                predictive value of screening and result in lowering the number of people who would otherwise have to
                undergo unnecessary and invasive procedures and provide physicians with greater confidence when
                follow-up is
                necessary.</p>



            <div style="height:44px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p><strong>How do CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung’s trial results compare to other diagnostic methods?<a id="top"
                        class="anchor" name="q3"></a><br></strong>Current diagnostic methods for lung cancer include PET
                scans, bronchoscopy, needle biopsy and tissue biopsy. CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung does not replace these
                tests.&nbsp; Instead, CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung is used by physicians for their patients who they suspect
                have
                lung cancer.&nbsp; CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung can add more certainty to diagnosis and the need for more
                invasive and more expensive tests.</p>



            <div style="height:18px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>The table below compares the sensitivity and specificity of CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung with tests and
                procedures currently used to diagnose lung cancer. CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung compares favorably to
                these
                more invasive and expensive procedures. A test validation trial comparing people at high risk for lung
                cancer to patients with the disease resulted in CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung specificity of 88% and
                sensitivity of 82%, similar to far more invasive procedures currently used to diagnose lung cancer.
                CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung performed even better, with 92% sensitivity and 87% specificity, in the
                group
                of cancer and cancer-free high-risk participants who had small nodules less than 20 mm in diameter or
                displayed no nodules. The high sensitivity and specificity of CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung for smaller
                nodules is
                important because nodules between 6 mm and 20 mm can pose more difficulty with diagnosis.&nbsp;
                CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung can provide more certainty to physicians and their patients.</p>

            <p><em>*Specificity is a measure of how many times the test correctly indicates that a person who does not
                    have
                    the disease is negative. **Sensitivity is a measure of how many times the test correctly indicates
                    that
                    a person who does have the disease is positive.</em></p>

            <p><strong>What does CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung detect in sputum?&nbsp;</strong></p><a id="top" class="anchor"
                name="q4"></a>



            <p>CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung interrogates the lung micro-environment by analyzing sputum using flow
                cytometry. The test acquires information about sputum using a flow cytometer that individually scans and
                characterizes tens of millions of cells in minutes. CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung labels a person’s
                sputum
                sample with fluorescent antibodies that uniquely identify different cell types and a fluorescent
                porphyrin
                called TCPP that preferentially binds to cancer cells and cancer-related cells. TCPP fluoresces a bright
                red
                color when attached to cancer cells and cancer-associated cells that is visible when the sample is run
                through a flow cytometer. CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung uses automated analysis that looks for pre-set
                parameters that are predictive of cancer, one of which is the presence of cells that have taken up
                greater
                amounts of the TCPP porphyrin label.</p>



            <div style="height:16px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p><strong>Why is it important that this clinical study compare sputum from people at high risk for lung
                    cancer
                    with those who have the disease?<a id="top" class="anchor" name="q5"></a><br></strong>A diagnostic
                should be tested in the population in which it will be used. In the case of lung cancer, the relevant
                population is people at high risk for the disease. As LDCT screening shows, it is difficult to tell the
                difference between someone with cancer and someone at high risk without cancer. Smoking severely damages
                the
                lungs, leading to respiratory conditions that confound analysis and can produce nodules that look like
                cancer on scans.</p>



            <div style="height:16px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>Many clinical studies of diagnostics on the market or in development compare cancer patients with healthy
                individuals, resulting in seemingly higher accuracy but lacking clinical relevance. The pathology of a
                healthy lung is very different from one with cancer, in contrast to the lungs of a high-risk individual
                without cancer who has endured the insult of smoking in comparison to the lungs of patients with lung
                cancer. The CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung trial compared these two very similar but difficult to
                distinguish
                cohorts – those at high risk with and those without cancer – to provide meaningful results for clinical
                use.

            <p><strong>How does this study build upon previous research?&nbsp;</strong><a id="top" class="anchor"
                    name="q6"></a><br>The test validation of CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung rests on a solid scientific
                foundation. Porphyrins have been known for decades to specifically concentrate in many types of cancer
                cells
                and cancer-associated cells such as macrophages that are cells that clean debris from the tissues in the
                body. In addition, certain porphyrins are naturally fluorescent, with a distinct photon emission
                profile.
                Early research conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory showed 100% accuracy in distinguishing lung
                cancer patients from healthy individuals by labeling sputum with the synthetic porphyrin TCPP. A later
                sputum cytology study published in 2015 showed that certain cells in sputum from lung cancer patients
                labeled by the porphyrin TCPP fluoresce a bright red color that can be measured under a microscope. In
                this
                trial, the results of which were published in 2015, study participants were classified into cancer
                versus
                high-risk cohorts with 81% accuracy. Building on this scientific foundation, the current
                CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung test still uses porphyrins but adds other markers to the analysis. In
                addition,
                the test is now performed on a flow cytometry platform which makes it possible to quickly analyze
                millions
                of cells in a single sputum sample.</p>

            <p><strong>What is novel about CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung?<a id="top" class="anchor"
                        name="q7"></a><br></strong>CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung is the first non-invasive, accurate and
                well-balanced test for lung cancer, meaning that our test has high specificity and high sensitivity,
                compared to other tests that claim high sensitivity and very low specificity, or vice versa.</p>



            <div style="height:16px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung investigates the lung micro-environment by analyzing sputum, using antibody
                staining of cells similar to the flow cytometry analysis of blood for lymphomas and other blood-related
                cancers. CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung uniquely incorporates the porphyrin TCPP to identify cancer and
                cancer-related populations in sputum. Test results that are provided to the physician ordering
                CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung are generated using automated analysis that is completed in minutes.</p>



            <div style="height:18px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p><strong>Why sputum?<br><a id="top" class="anchor" name="q8"></a></strong>Exfoliated cells in sputum have
                long
                been of interest for lung cancer diagnosis. Traditional slide-based sputum cytology, which looks at only
                a
                fraction of the entire sputum sample, has been shown to detect lung cancer in 60% to 82% of
                cases<sup>6</sup>.</p>



            <div style="height:19px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>Sputum bathes the lungs, coming into direct contact with a possible tumor that sheds cancerous and
                cancer-related cells, making sputum an excellent sample for cancer detection.</p>



            <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>Sputum can be collected easily at home, either spontaneously or with assistance from a non-invasive,
                hand-held airway clearing device that helps people expel the sample into a collection cup.</p>



            <div style="height:41px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p><strong>How do people collect their sputum sample?<a id="top" class="anchor" name="q9"></a><br></strong>A
                physician orders CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung and gives the patient a sputum collection kit to take
                home.
                The kit includes one test collection cup; a pre-addressed, overnight envelope for returning the sample;
                a
                patient instruction booklet; and a small cold pack to be placed in the freezer during the three-day
                collection period. Patients collect a sputum sample at home every day for three consecutive days,
                expelling
                sputum and storing the three-day sample in the same collection cup. Sputum is expelled and collected by
                coughing into the collection cup. The patient stores the collection cup in a refrigerator between
                collections.</p>



            <div style="height:18px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>On the third day of collection, the patient places the collection cup containing the sputum sample back
                into
                the kit box for return by overnight mail to the laboratory. The patient adds the frozen cold pack to the
                kit
                box that contains his or her sputum sample prior to sending it to the laboratory for analysis.</p>



            <div style="height:41px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p><strong>Can the test be used for more types of cancer and lung diseases?<a id="top" class="anchor"
                        name="q10"></a><br></strong>bioAffinity Technologies plans to develop additional cancer
                diagnostics
                using its flow cytometry platform. The Company also plans to develop tests related to the health of the
                lung, including diagnostics for asthma and COPD. Additional research and development are required to
                bring
                these tests to market.</p>

            <p><strong>How can I order CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung?&nbsp;</strong><a id="top" class="anchor"
                    name="q11"></a><br>A physician must order CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung for his or her patient.
                CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung has been licensed by Precision Pathology Services (<a
                    href="http://www.precisionpath.us/">http://www.precisionpath.us/</a>) that has developed
                CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in accordance with the College of
                American
                Pathologists (CAP) and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) guidelines and regulations.
                Precision Pathology Services is an accredited CAP/CLIA laboratory in San Antonio, Texas.
                &nbsp;Physicians
                may order the CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung from Precision Pathology Services for their patients who are
                smokers
                and former smokers at high risk for lung cancer and who receive a positive screening result or otherwise
                are
                suspected of having the disease.&nbsp; Patients should speak with their physicians to determine if
                CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung is right for them.</p>



            <div style="height:41px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p><strong>Can you explain the differences between CyPath<sup>®</sup> Lung and liquid biopsies?<a id="top"
                        class="anchor" name="q13"></a><br></strong>Most liquid biopsies are used&nbsp;<em>after a tissue
                    biopsy</em>&nbsp;has confirmed a diagnosis to identify specific gene mutations in the tumor cells.
                This
                information helps inform therapeutic choices by giving physicians the opportunity to select drugs that
                target the cellular pathways that are affected by the gene mutations. CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung
                detects
                lung cancer in high-risk individuals prior to a tissue biopsy or other confirmatory tests that establish
                the
                person has lung cancer.</p>



            <div style="height:17px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>Some liquid biopsies seek to find cancer earlier. So far, diagnostic liquid biopsies for early lung
                cancer
                show high sensitivity and very low specificity, or vice versa. Low sensitivity means a test misses the
                majority of cancers for which it is testing, leading to high false negatives. Low specificity means the
                test
                misses the majority of people who do not have cancer, instead calling them positive, leading to many
                unnecessary follow-up tests. CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung is different, showing both high specificity
                and
                sensitivity in testing for lung cancer.</p>



            <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung analyzes the lung micro-environment by looking for pre-set parameters
                indicative
                of having lung cancer. Flow cytometry, the platform used by CyPath<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Lung for analysis,
                profiles cell populations, i.e., whole cells, to detect disease. Liquid biopsies most often analyze
                blood
                samples. Although some identify whole cells as well (so-called circulating tumor cells), most liquid
                biopsies look for genetic fragments of cancer cells in blood.</p>



            <div style="height:22px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>Sputum is much more concentrated with cancer-related cells and cancer-related material than blood,
                providing
                a better sample to analyze for lung cancer.</p>



            <div style="height:16px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>Several companies are developing “pan-cancer” blood tests (liquid biopsies), meaning that one blood draw
                could be used to detect one or more of 50 cancers. This approach limits the search for specific
                mutations,
                which is especially problematic for lung cancer since lung cancer is known to be associated with many
                different types of mutations.</p>



            <div style="height:18px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



            <p>Sputum travels well. A three-day sample overnighted to the laboratory exhibits high viability, with on
                average more than 60% of cells arriving alive for processing. In comparison, blood can be especially
                vulnerable to handling and processing problems. DNA, RNA and proteins tend to degrade quickly when
                processed
                inappropriately. Degradation of test targets is a particular concern when the targets are rare, as is
                the
                case with early-stage cancers.</p>
